# Project 1 : The Calculator Project
## Introduction
The purpose of my project is to create a basic calculator, creating functions only for the use of the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two values. If the user inputs a valid operation, the program will proceed accordingly. However, if the user inputs an invalid operation, "Invalid" will by printed and the user will be asked to repeatedly insert another operation until it is valid.
