# Project 1 : The Calculator Project
## Introduction
The purpose of my project is to create a basic calculator, creating functions only for the use of the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponent of two values. If the user inputs a valid operation, the program will proceed accordingly. However, if the user inputs an invalid operation, "Input Is Invalid" will by printed and the user will be asked to repeatedly insert another operation until it is valid.

## How my code works:
1. Firstly, I defined five different functions, one for each of the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponent. Creating these functions ensures that these operations are completing their respective tasks in the body of my code.

2. Secondly, I printed the five different operations to make sure that the user is well aware of the different options that he or she is able to choose from. When my code is running, this is the first thing that will be seen.

3. Next, there will be user input. The user will be asked to enter the operation of his or her choice; in other words, the user will be asked to choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponent. 

4. Then, whichever operation is chosen, the user will be asked to input two values to either be added, subtracted, mulitplied, divided, or to the exponent respectively.

5. The following operations will then be performed:
  a. If addition is chosen, the two values will be added in no particular order.
  
  b. If subtraction is chosen, value two will be subtracted from value one.
  
  c. If multiplication is chosen, the two values will be mulitplied by each other in no particular order.
  
  d. If division is chosen, the second value will be divided by the first value.
  
  e. If exponent is chosen, the first value will be to the power of the second value.
  
6. If an invalid operation is inputed by the user, he or she will be repeatedly be asked to input an operation until it is valid.
 
 ## Output
 After running the code, the user should be able to see something along the lines of this:
