# Project 2 : The Hangman Game

## Introduction

#### The purpose of my project is to implement a simple hangman game, with only 10 guesses, and a decryption mechanism. Firstly, the hangman game function will conveniently show dashes wherever the letters are not guessed, the number of remaining incorrect guesses, letters that were guessed correctly, and letters that had already been guessed. If the number of guesses reaches zero before the user guesses the correct word, a statement will show up on the screen reciting: "You lose. the secret word is ____." However, if the user decodes the correct word before the number of guesses is up, the following will show up on the screen: "Congradulations! You guessed the correct word!"
